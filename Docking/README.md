## Development

### Setup the RaspberryPi
The game is supposed to be ran on a RaspberryPi. Python Arcade library is used for this game and such library requires python 3.6 or later. 
On Raspbian lite, first time only, run following commands:

1- Requirements setup:
```bash
sudo apt-get install build-essential checkinstall
sudo apt-get install libreadline-gplv2-dev libncursesw5-dev libssl-dev libsqlite3-dev tk-dev libgdbm-dev libc6-dev 
libbz2-dev libffi-dev libjpeg-dev freeglut3-dev
```

2- Python3.6 setup:
```bash
sudo apt-get install python3-pip python3-dev
wget https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.6.8/Python-3.6.8.tgz  
tar xvf Python-3.6.8.tgz
cd Python-3.6.8
./configure --enable-optimizations --with-ensurepip=install
make -j4  
sudo make altinstall
```

3- Clone the game repository locally:
```bash
sudo apt-get install git
git clone https://github.com/NiokyWi/docking_iss.git
```

4- Install requirements:
```bash
pip3.6 install -r requirements.txt
```

### Customize the game
Several variable are available from the `main.py` file. There you can change:
* `FULLSCREEN`: by default `True` means it will display on the whole screen size
* `DEBUG_MODE`: display debug data and target. By default `False`
* `SCALE_SPEED`: set the ATV approach speed. Nothing physical but by default `0.001`
* `INIT_DELTA_TIME`: set the delay (in seconds) the initialisation take. By default 10s.
